Born in 1999 in Abhar, Mahdi pursued his bachelor's degree in applied chemistry at “Yazd University “ and “Isfahan University of Science and Technology” between 2018 and 2022. Following this, he gained one year of experience as a scientific researcher at the organic laboratory in the central laboratory of Yazd University. Presently, he is pursuing a master's degree in organic chemistry at the Iran University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Professor Ali Maleki.
While Mahdi's research has predominantly centered on catalysts, there is a clear shift in focus toward a specific type of catalyst known as nanozymes. This transition is a testament to Mahdi's evolving research interests. Additionally, Mahdi has developed a keen interest in the biochemistry of cancer and other diseases.
